Weekly Assignment
-----------------

Read the two papers for class. Submit one or two questions from each paper by noon on the day of class.

Assignment 1
------------

In Ses #5 you will be given a scientific paper without the abstract and the title. You will write a title and an abstract that reports the findings in the paper. Assignment 1 is due in Ses #8.

Assignment 2
------------

You will write a short research proposal (2-3 pages) about how to identify an approach to design the next blockbuster drug to treat or cure one of the disorders discussed in class. You may also choose a cholesterol-related disorder not discussed in class. Your proposal should have a (a) title, (b) short abstract, (c) introduction explaining the disease/disorder, the phenotype, prevalence, molecular mechanism if known and shortcomings in the field in treating this disorder, (d) methodology and design strategy behind your invention (will it be an improved version of a drug already on the market or will it be completely new?), (e) discussion of why this drug will be superior to other drugs on the market, and (f) references. You should submit the proposal in Ses #12, and we will discuss your proposals on the last class in Ses #13.
